## ⚙️ Industry Context
India’s two-wheeler market (~₹80,000 crore) is witnessing rapid electrification.  
While Delhi, Bengaluru, and Pune dominate EV sales, smaller cities represent **the next 60% growth frontier**.  
Tier-2 cities like Lucknow have higher daily commuting distances (8–12 km/day), perfect for electric scooters.

**Barriers holding back expansion:**
- Poor visibility of charging points ⚡  
- Lack of reliable service centers 🔧  
- Low consumer trust due to limited local success stories  
- Cost perception: “EVs are premium, not practical”  

**Opportunity:**  
Government incentives (FAME-II), battery price drops, and Tier-2 infrastructure upgrades make 2025–2027 ideal for EV penetration.
