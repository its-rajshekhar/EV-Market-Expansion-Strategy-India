**Author: Raj Shekhar Mishra | Lucknow, India**

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on designing a market expansion plan for a leading electric scooter manufacturer aiming to penetrate Tier-2 Indian cities — starting with Lucknow and Kanpur.  
It combines secondary research, consumer insights, infrastructure analysis, and a strategic go-to-market plan to estimate adoption potential and recommend execution steps.

## ⚙️ Background
India’s EV market is booming, yet 80% of sales remain concentrated in Tier-1 cities like Bengaluru, Delhi, and Pune.  
Tier-2 cities hold untapped demand but face barriers like:
- Limited charging infrastructure ⚡  
- Poor after-sales service networks 🔧  
- Consumer skepticism around maintenance 🪫  

## 📊 Primary Research Summary
I conducted informal surveys and interviews with 50+ two-wheeler users in **Lucknow, Kanpur, and Varanasi** to understand awareness and intent.  

| Insight | Observation | Implication |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Awareness | 82% had heard about EVs | Market educated but hesitant |
| Cost Concern | 73% felt EVs are expensive | Highlight total cost of ownership |
| Charging | 68% unaware of charging points | Visibility problem, not just availability |
| Trust | 55% unsure of service centers | Requires after-sales partnerships |
