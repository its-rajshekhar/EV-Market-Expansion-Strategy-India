## 📘 Executive Summary
This project is a complete **business case study and go-to-market plan** for expanding an electric scooter company into **Tier-2 Indian cities** (Lucknow, Kanpur, and Varanasi).  
It replicates how a real **product analyst or APM** at companies like Swiggy or Meesho would approach a data-backed market launch — including **research, financial modelling, and strategy design**.

The study covers:
- Market analysis and customer segmentation  
- Infrastructure & partnership strategy  
- Financial projections and sensitivity modeling  
- Implementation roadmap with KPIs  
- Recommendations & reflections  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Assess the viability of EV adoption in Tier-2 cities.  
2. Build an actionable GTM roadmap for the first 18 months.  
3. Identify key financial metrics and breakeven scenarios.  
4. Design a service and partnership ecosystem.  
5. Communicate insights visually and narratively for stakeholders.

## 🧩 Market Context

- India’s EV market is expected to grow 49% CAGR till 2030 (NITI Aayog).  
- Metro cities already show maturity; **Tier-2 cities** are the next frontier.  
- State subsidies (UP EV Policy 2022) offer ₹10,000–₹20,000 per 2W EV.  
- Consumers express high awareness but low trust in service reliability.

## 🧭 Research Approach

### 🔹 Primary Research
Conducted 74 consumer interviews and field surveys in Lucknow, Kanpur, and Varanasi across:
- Students  
- Delivery riders  
- Local mechanics  
- Office workers  

Key insights:
- 87% know about EVs but 63% don’t know nearby charging stations.  
- 72% want EMIs instead of upfront cost.  
- Mechanics are open to OEM training if certified.  

### 🔹 Secondary Research
- Reviewed FAME-II incentives, UP EV Policy.  
- Studied competitor strategies (Ola Electric, Hero, Ather).  
- Estimated infrastructure density and per-station cost benchmarks.
