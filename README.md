# EV Market Expansion Strategy — India 2025
**Created by Raj Shekhar Mishra | Lucknow, India**

## 🎯 Objective
To design a data-driven market expansion strategy for an electric scooter brand planning to enter Tier-2 Indian cities, beginning with Lucknow and Kanpur.

## ⚡ Background
With rising fuel prices and environmental awareness, electric scooters are gaining popularity.  
However, penetration outside Tier-1 cities remains low due to poor charging infrastructure and pricing concerns.

## 🧩 Research Summary
- Surveyed 50+ potential users in Lucknow & Kanpur.  
- Found 68% are open to switching to EVs if cost parity & service centers improve.  
- Key barrier: “Battery anxiety” and “maintenance doubts”.

## 📊 Market Sizing (Estimates)
| City | Scooter Owners | EV Adoption Potential | Service Centers Needed |
|------|----------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Lucknow | 6.2 Lakh | 18% | 8 |
| Kanpur | 5.4 Lakh | 15% | 6 |
| Varanasi | 3.1 Lakh | 12% | 4 |

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations
1. Launch pilot in **Lucknow** — strong disposable income and road infra.  
2. Introduce **Battery Swap Stations** at key fuel pumps.  
3. Partner with **colleges & corporates** for bulk fleet orders.  
4. Offer **3-year free service** to overcome trust issues.  

## 📈 Success Metrics
- City-level adoption ≥ 15% by Year 2  
- Service uptime ≥ 98%  
- Break-even within 14 months  

## 🗒 Raj’s Reflection
> “EV adoption in Tier-2 cities is not just about product — it’s about building *trust* through after-sales and visibility.”

## 🎯 Outcome
A realistic, data-backed expansion plan that demonstrates strategic thinking, customer insight, and market analysis skills.
