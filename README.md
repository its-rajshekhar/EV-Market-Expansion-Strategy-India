## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

1. **Shift marketing from discounts → reliability.**  
   Highlight charging uptime & service coverage rather than ₹-off campaigns.  
2. **Build “EV Trust Index.”**  
   Rate all service centers, charging stations, and battery health transparently in-app.  
3. **Franchise Service Model.**  
   Train small garages to become “Authorized EV Hubs” for local maintenance.  
4. **Community EV Days.**  
   Organize Sunday events with test drives + Q&A to build trust.

## 🧠 Reflection by Raj Shekhar Mishra

> “This project was inspired by my own observations in Lucknow — where people admire EVs but hesitate to switch due to the unknowns.  
> I realized that adoption isn’t about affordability alone; it’s about *confidence in continuity.*  
> If service, charging, and resale are solved — Tier-2 markets will lead the EV revolution faster than metros.”
